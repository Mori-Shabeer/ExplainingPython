## **Get Started**
-	To get started we will need to first download Python onto our local system. To do so, please go on python.org/downloads, there you will find the download link.<br>
**NOTE: The website will automatically recognise what type of operating system your local machine is using (MacOS, Windows or Linux)**
-	Once you have downloaded Python please download Pycharm, type into Google Pycharm Download and you should find the website to download. <br>
**NOTE: Please ensure you download the Community Edition of Pycharm**

### **What is Python** 
-	**High-level programming language:** Python is known for its clear and readable syntax, making it easier to learn and use compared to many other languages. 
-	**Versatile:** Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science and machine learning, scripting, automation, and more. 
-	**Object-Oriented:** Python supports object-oriented programming principles like classes, objects, and inheritance, allowing you to structure your code in a modular and organized way. 
-	**Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line, making it easier to debug and test. 
-	**Large and active community:** Python has a vast and supportive community, providing extensive documentation, libraries, and resources for developers. 
-	**Open-source:** Python is open-source and free to use, making it accessible to everyone.

### **Python & Pycharm**
-	When you start Pycharm to test that your Python is operating properly we will do the ‘Hello World’ test.
-	Start a new Python file on Pycharm and lets name Python practise. Pycharm will automatically make it a .pd file. Once the new python file is made please type in PRINT(‘Hello World’)
-	Once you type it out please run it and one of two results should happen. If you have successfully downloaded everything you should see ‘Hello World’. If not you should see an error message, if so please re-download Python and Pycharm if needed.

### **Data Types**
-	**Numbers:** There two type of number data types we tend to do deal with in Python they are integers which are whole numbers or floating point numbers which deal with number with decimals
-	**String:** Which deal with characters or text
-	**Boolean:** Which are either true or false statements
-	To view what type of data you are dealing with you can run this code; PRINT(type(Enter a statement or number))
. **NOTE: There many type of data we can deal with in Python but these are the 3 most common.**

### **Numbers in Python**
-	**Represent numerical values:** Used to represent quantities, measurements, and perform mathematical calculations.
- **Types:**
  - **Integers (int):** Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
  -	**Floats (float):** Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).

### **String in Python**
- **Sequence of characters:** A string is a collection of characters (letters, numbers, symbols, spaces) enclosed within single quotes (') or double quotes (").
- **Immutable:** Once created, a string cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.
- **Used for text:** Strings are fundamental for representing text data like names, messages, file paths, and more.<br>
- **NOTE: String types:** https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

### **Variables in Python**
-	**Hold data:** Variables are like containers that store data within a Python program.
-	**Named storage locations:** They are given meaningful names to represent the information they hold (e.g., age, name, price).
-	**Dynamic Typing:** Python determines the data type (integer, string, etc.) of a variable automatically based on the value assigned to it.
-	**Created by assignment:** You create a variable by assigning a value to it using the = operator (e.g., age = 30, name = "John").
-	**Case-sensitive:** Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different variables).
-	**Naming conventions:** Use descriptive names for better readability (e.g., customer_name instead of c).
-	**Reassignable:** You can change the value stored in a variable at any time.<br>

### **Commands in Python**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `# (Followed by any statement)` | Allows Python to recognize that this is not a piece of code it needs to run as you are just commenting. |
| `print('Followed by text')` | Allows you to display text, or an answer you are seeking. |
| `print(type(Enter a statement or number))` | Allows to see what data type you are dealing with. |
| `print(len(Followed by statement))` | Allows you to find out the length or total characters in your string statement. |
| `print(string.upper())` | Converts all characters in the string to uppercase. |
| `print(string.lower())` | Converts all characters in the string to lowercase. |
| `print(string.split())` | Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a separator (default is whitespace). |
| `print(string.join(list))` | Joins a list of strings into a single string using the string as a separator. |
| `print(string.find(substring))` | Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring within the string. |
| `print(string.replace(old, new))` | Returns a new string with all occurrences of the old substring replaced with the new substring. |

### **Arithmetic Operators in Python**

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `+` | Addition | `5 + 3 = 8` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `10 - 4 = 6` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `2 * 5 = 10` |
| `/` | Division | `10 / 2 = 5.0` |
| `//` | Floor Division | `10 // 3 = 3` |
| `%` | Modulus | `10 % 3 = 1` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | `2 ** 3 = 8` |
